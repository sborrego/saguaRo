# saguaRo

Have you ever wanted your data visualizations to represent the beauty of
Arizona? Maybe you havenâ€™t yet realized this desire, but this color
palette package is perfect for you! This is a fun project for me that I
put together to feature the many colors of the beautiful Arizona desert.
Enjoy!

## Installation

<!-- You can install the released version of saguaRo from [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with: -->
<!-- ``` r -->
<!-- install.packages("saguaRo") -->
<!-- ``` -->

You can install the development version from
[GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("sborrego/saguaRo")
```

## Colors

Welcome to the desert! These are the color palettes and names available
in `saguaRo`.

``` r
library(saguaRo)
all_saguaro()
```

Forgot the colors in the color palette of your choice? No problem! Just
use the function `display_saguaro()` with any color palette name and see
the beauty of the desert appear before your eyes!

``` r
library(saguaRo)
display_saguaro("bloom")
```

### Use

But how do you even use it? Use the function `saguaro()` with the
palette name and optionally the number of colors you would like.

``` r
library(saguaRo)

n_list <- c(4, 3, 6, 5, 7)

pie(n_list, 
    main = "Super Basic Pie Chart", 
    col = saguaro("bloom", length(n_list)))
```

<img src="man/figures/README-unnamed-chunk-4-1.png" width="100%" />

Take your data visualizations even futher by extending the vibrant
colors of `saguaRo` with the essential
[`RColorBrewer`](https://www.r-graph-gallery.com/38-rcolorbrewers-palettes.html)
package.

``` r
library(saguaRo)
library(RColorBrewer)

num_data <- runif(20, 3, 12)

pie(num_data,
    main = "Color Ramp Pie Chart",
    col = colorRampPalette(saguaro("mariposa"))(20))
```

<img src="man/figures/README-unnamed-chunk-5-1.png" width="100%" />

Need to see your color palette of choice in action ASAP? Use
`plot_saguaro()` with any color palette name and plot selected boxplot
(box), density (density), dotplot (gradient), or circular packing chart
(circle).

``` r
plot_saguaro("oriole", "circle")
```

<!-- You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date. `devtools::build_readme()` is handy for this. You could also use GitHub Actions to re-render `README.Rmd` every time you push. An example workflow can be found here: <https://github.com/r-lib/actions/tree/master/examples>. -->
<!-- You can also embed plots, for example: -->
<!-- ```{r pressure, echo = FALSE} -->
<!-- plot(pressure) -->
<!-- ``` -->
<!-- In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub and CRAN. -->
